Installation
============

Check out this repository to ~/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/JSHint

and for windows %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages\JSHint

This version contains a Windows and OSX jshint.sublime-build file

I recommend deleting and renaming the ones that applies to you.

Usage
=====
Command-b on any JavaScript file will run JSHint on it.

Updating
========
git pull inside the package anytime for the latest
